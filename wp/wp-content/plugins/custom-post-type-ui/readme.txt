Admin UI for creating custom post types and custom taxonomies in WordPress

== Description ==

This plugin provides an easy to use interface for creating and administrating custom post types and taxonomies in WordPress.  This plugin is created for WordPress 3.0 and higher.

Please note that Custom Post Type UI alone will not display post types or taxonomies data in customized places within your site; it simply registers them for you to use. Check out [Custom Post Type UI Extended](https://pluginize.com/product/custom-post-type-ui-extended/?utm_source=cptui-desription&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=wporg) for an easy way to display post type content from any registered types on your site, including those created with Custom Post Type UI and more.

All official development on this plugin is on GitHub. New releases are still published here on WordPress.org. The version shown here should be considered the latest stable release. You can find the repo at [https://github.com/WebDevStudios/custom-post-type-ui](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/custom-post-type-ui). Please file confirmed issues, bugs, and enhancement ideas there, when possible.

[Pluginize](https://pluginize.com/?utm_source=cptui&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=wporg) was launched in 2016 by [WebDevStudios](https://webdevstudios.com/) to promote, support, and house all of their [WordPress products](https://pluginize.com/shop/?utm_source=cptui-&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=wporg). Pluginize is not only [creating new products for WordPress all the time, like CPTUI Extended](https://pluginize.com/product/custom-post-type-ui-extended/?utm_source=cptui&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=wporg), but also provides ongoing support and development for WordPress community favorites like [CMB2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cmb2/) and more.
